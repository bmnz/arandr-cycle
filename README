arandr-cycle is meant to be attached to a FN+keypress to serve the function of the "projector" button on most laptops. This function was absent for me while using my Thinkpad X1 in #!. ARandR can save a very nice shell script as you customize your screen layout, and I got tired of going to the folder I keep them in to pick which one I currently need.
